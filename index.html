      <p>Kickboxing is a full-contact hybrid martial art and boxing type based on punching and kicking. Kickboxing
        originated in the 1950s to 1970s.[2] The fight takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, mouth
        guards, shorts, and bare feet to favor the use of kicks. Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general
        fitness, or for competition.[3][4][5] Some styles of kickboxing include: full contact karate, Muay Thai,
        Japanese kickboxing, Lethwei, Sanda, and Savate.</p>
